In short, you must build and train a classifier given a labeled dataset and then use it to infer the labels of a given unlabeled evaluation dataset. You must then submit the inferred labels in a specified format, which will be compared to the ground truth. The accuracy of your model is proportional to the grade you receive. (Scaling will be done according to three parameters: a benchmark accuracy, a baseline accuracy, and a teacher's accuracy).
